# Hi there 👋, I'm Razor

Well I'm a French student currently studying for a BTS SIO SLAM. I'm diving deeper into the world of software development, aiming to master Mobile Development and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Curious by nature, always learning, and passionate about building cool things. 🚀
